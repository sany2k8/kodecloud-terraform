# Create a CloudWatch alarm named nautilus-alarm. 
- The alarm should monitor CPU utilization of an EC2 instance.
- Trigger the alarm when CPU utilization exceeds 80%. Set the evaluation period to 5 minutes. 
- Use a single evaluation period. Ensure that the entire configuration is implemented using Terraform. 
- The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.
