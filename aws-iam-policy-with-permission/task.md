# Create an IAM policy named iampolicy_jim in us-east-1 region using Terraform. 

- It must allow read-only access to the EC2 console, i.e., this policy must allow users to view all instances, AMIs, and snapshots in the Amazon EC2 console.

- The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.
